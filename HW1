Question 3: 

Theoretical probability of roll - the expectation is to roll a 6 at least once  1/36 (.02778)


How to create a fair dice simulation in R. First we begin by creating a variable called dice rolls and set the size to 2 so we make clear we are using 2 dice and any time we roll we want replacements of numbers.

```{r}
die.rolls <- function (){
  dice <- sample(x=1:6, size = 2, replace = TRUE)}

```

Then we want to create a simulation that runs this 20 times

```{r}
simtrial <- replicate(20,die.rolls())
```

Then create a table to of the simulation once its complete.

```{r}
table(simtrial)
```
Results of the experimental probability is ____/36 (probability)

#Then generate the frequency of the outcome and plot the data

Frequency - this is the % of times we virtually rolled the numbers below

```{r}
table(simtrial)/length(simtrial)
```


Plot - This plots the number of times in the simulation roll that we record a number 

```{r}
plot(table(simtrial), xlab = 'Dice number', ylab = 'Frequency', main = '20 Rolls of 2 Fair Dice')
```

Question 4:

x <- 1:50
w <- 1 + sqrt(x)/2
example1 <- data.frame(x=x, y= x + rnorm(x)*w)
attach(example1)
fm <- lm(y ~ x)
summary(fm)

lrf <- lowess(x, y)
plot(x, y)
lines(x, lrf$y)
abline(0, 1, lty=3)
abline(coef(fm))

load("/Users/mostafaragheb/Desktop/CCNY/4th ( Fall 2020)/Economatrics/HW1/acs2017_ny/acs2017_ny_data.RData")

acs2017_ny[1:10,1:7]
attach(acs2017_ny)
summary(acs2017_ny)
print(NN_obs <- length(AGE)) 

summary(AGE[Female == 1])

summary(acs2017_ny)

length(acs2017_ny$AGE)

summary(acs2017_ny$AGE)


print(NN_obs <- length(AGE))

summary(AGE[female == 1])

summary(AGE[!female])

summary(AGE[female == 0])

mean(AGE[female == 1])

sd(AGE[female == 1])

mean(AGE[!female])

sd(AGE[!female])

summary(educ_college[female == 1])
summary(educ_college[female == 0])
mean(educ_college[female == 1])
sd(educ_college[female == 1])
sd(educ_college[female == 0])

# A Minor diff between men and woman in College education 
#female has a higher average with Slighly higher SD than men 





Question 5: 



setwd("~/Desktop/CCNY/4th ( Fall 2020)/Economatrics/HW1")
`S_P_Stock_Price` <- read.csv("~/Desktop/CCNY/4th ( Fall 2020)/Economatrics/HW1/S&P 500 Index Price.csv")
View(`S_P_Stock_Price`)



Analyzing Stock Prices in R studio - Nicole Kerrison

#Make sure you upload only csv files and never excel

Calculating the returns on the S&P with the data imported in R

This tells you the values at the beginning of the table


```{r}
head(S_P_Stock_Price)
```

This tells you the values at the end of the table

```{r}
tail(S_P_Stock_Price)
```


this brings up just the adj close numbers of the S&P

```{r}
S_P_Stock_Price[1:30, "Adj.Close"]
```


We want to isolate the adj close values of the s&p in order to calculate returns

obtain the specific price between these dates. The brackets are blank because there is only 
21 values in the data set. We would need a range or index if there was more. 

```{r}
new_price <- S_P_Stock_Price[ ,"Adj.Close"]
```


Now we create a new variable with just the adjusted close prices


sp_pricenew <- S_P_Stock_Price[, "Adj.Close", drop = FALSE]
rownames(sp_pricenew)<- S_P_Stock_Price$Date
head(sp_pricenew)



continuous compounding returns
you want to find the return over a period of time and need to provide a value "n"
so in your calculation you know that you are subtracting from the previous day


n <-nrow(sp_pricenew)

sp_returns <- log(sp_pricenew[2:n,1])-log(sp_pricenew[1:(n-1),1])
```


Assign a name to the continuous returns 

```{r}
names(sp_returns)<-S_P_Stock_Price[2:n,1]
head(sp_returns)
```


summary of the new data by running a quick analysis

```{r}
summary(sp_returns)
```


observing all of the data at once

```{r}
print(sp_returns)
```

And finally to view the data as a row/columnn, use function below. This will allow you to see that there are specific dates where negative returns have followed a positive return day - ex 7/27 and consecutive days of postive returns followed a negative return day ex: 7/7, 7/16, 7/23 "this has more pos days"

```{r}
cbind(sp_returns)
```


Graph the returns (If you wish)

```{r}
plot(sp_returns, type = "l", col = "blue", lwd = 2, 
     ylab = "Returns", main = "Daily Returns for S&P 500 in July")
legend(x = 'topleft', legend = 'sp_returns', lty = 1, lwd = 2, col = 'blue')

```
